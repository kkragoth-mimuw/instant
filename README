* Compiler is written using Rust (https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)

To install Rust on students run:
$ wget -O rustup.sh https://sh.rustup.rs && sh rustup.sh -y

If during compiling there is problem with cargo build:
error: no default toolchain configured

please run
$ rustup install stable
$ rustup default stable

* I'm using larlpop library (https://github.com/lalrpop/lalrpop) to parse and generate ast.
